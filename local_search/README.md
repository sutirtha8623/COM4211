# Clarifications

## Running the code

Just type in and you are good to go.

```bash
python3 nQueens.py
```

## Board representation

Please note that the board/state is represented by a single array say, ```a``` where each index ```i``` of the array represents the column the queen is in and the respective element ```a[i]``` represents the row where the queen is in the ```i```th column. Bascially ```(a[i], i)``` represents the position a queen is in for each index of the array.
